Game idea #1:
Vampire Survivors
Top down stealth combat game, where our protagonist insists on not using guns. As such they have to find
creative and stealthy ways to close the distance to their enemies, where being caught out in the open means
certain death.

Game idea #2:
Kingdom Rush
A tower defence game where you play as a fragile engineer who you have to maneuver around the map and around enemies
to upgrade, place and maintain your towers without being seen (probably better if 3D... But otherwise this will probably be easier.)
