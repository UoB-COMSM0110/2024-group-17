Game One - Stealth Melee

Idea:
Top down stealth combat game, where our protagonist insists on not using guns. As such they have to find
creative and stealthy ways to close the distance to their enemies, where being caught out in the open means
certain death.

Game inspo:
Hotline Miami, Heat signature, Hitman

Art style inspo:
Dead cells, Hyper light drifter, Into the breach (pixel art with lighting engine)

Setting:
a. maybe a current day baddass, like john wick etc
b. super hero who doesnt want to kill (ie, batman)
c. baddass ww2 fightign nazis ! (in this case he doesnt use guns because he wasnts to feel the nazis bones break in his hands)
d. dystopian future overthrowing a fascist government (would be cool, but kinda undermines the joke of the idea)

Challenge #1 - Physics
It should feel intuitive to move around, responsive and clean. There should be a weight to combat, with a good lunge to close
that last bit of distance. Ray casting will be nessesary for the gunfire of the enemies. The movemenet of the camera is also 
incredibly important.

Challenge #2 - AI
The actual AI of the enemies is one of the biggest challenges of a stealth game. Making the enemies feel competant and real,
whilst not letting them have any information it feels like they shouldnt. There should also be a good system of control
over the sound, maybe a way of visualising where they enemy can see, and how far the sound you makes travels. 

Challenge #3 - Lighting engines, Particle effects, Map game and UI design
Actually making the game look good is incredibly important. I think pixel art is good for us to do as it is slightly easier and 
there are lots  of tools to help draw and animate it. I think a dynamic lighting engine would make it actually look good tho, 
this can be difficult in 2D, if we can figure it out it will make it look so much better with not huge performance impacts. 
We can pretty quickly put  a decent level and ui together, good enough for a demo.
