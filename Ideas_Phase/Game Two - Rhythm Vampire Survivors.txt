Game Two: Vampire Survivors, except its a rhythm game. 

A 2D isometric view world with the camera centred on the player.
Endless hordes of monstrosities from the far reaches of space are
attacking the player, a lone spaceman with little but a jetpack.

Can you survive the 3 and a half minutes it is going to take for
your automated life pod to come and rescue you?
