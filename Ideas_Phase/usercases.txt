We want to make a game that is actually good, with elements that are cohesive and engaging to implement. We want to use tech which
interests us and we havent used before, to make us better developers. We also want a good mark. 


User: Markers
As a marker, I want the game to be as intuitive as possible, so I can see as much of the game as possible to give a fair mark for it.
I want the game to be enjoyable, pretty, and with technically impressive aspects. I want a clear indication of three challenges,
and a clear twist that separates this game out from other projects and the game used for inspiration.

As someone who has only ever played mario kart with my nephew, I need the game to have an extensive tutorial, and the game to have a casual mode that I
can enjoy. It should be easy to learn hard to master, and I should be able to restart quickly for the next attempt. I'd quite like a story, so I can
enjoy the game in short bursts on the bus etc.

I want depth of mechanics, with lots of potential for me to show my skills. I want there to be swag strats and exploits that make my run engaging to
watch and perform. Maybe an infinite mode that just gets unfairly hard so I can impress people.

I want a game that is easy to learn. I want nice graphics, and a game I can just enjoy with immersive gameplay with satisfying physics. I do not want a
scoring system, because I just want to enjoy it and not have a competition with anyone but myself.

User Stories:

As a marker:
	1. The marker will immediately know from the first screen how to play the game
	2. On the main menu, there will be the controls, settings menu, and a big "start" button
	3. Once the game starts, there will be prompts for the appropriate controls when they're needed, in case they miss them on the main menu
	4. A prompt will show to indicate that there is a rhythm element to the game, and the UI will indicate this by changing colour with the beat also
	5. Look for three impressive elements that would clearly take coordination and effort from the development team
	6. Is it clear that it was a team creating the game (a diverse range of features, that make the most of every team member's individual skills)
	7. Once the game ends, it should be clear how to exit, or restart if the game is fun!

As a Normal Gamer:
 	1. The gamer will open the game
	2. They'll easily be able to start the game
	3. Same as marker, but will be able to just enjoy the game without time constraints
	4. Will be able to enjoy the graphics
